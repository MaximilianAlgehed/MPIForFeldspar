# TODO

## Implementation
* File IO

## Documentation
* Make a proper package out of this

## Examples
* Pretty up the user-input in the DFT example
* Implement (understand...) FFT

## On to the science
* DAGs of computation with the same type
  on each node
  (in effect a dag of functions: a -> Run a)
